                <h1>What is the cloud?</h1>
             <p>
                The cloud is a data storage service on the internet. 
                Whether they are databases, documents, images or music,
                this service also allows you to create a universal 
                access for the transmission of information between various
                devices and that you can share your files with your contacts 
                or have access to them anywhere.

                    <h1> Why should I backup my information in the cloud? </h1>
                   <p>
                        As we mentioned before, this type of platform has as its main objective the use of documents and information through
                       any device and any place that has internet access. Second, there is the release of storage in the different media; 
                      Since all this documentation is online, there is no need to take up space on devices, and you can optimize not only the memory, but also the speed of your PC,
                      tablet or smartphone. 
                    </p>

                    <h1> What are the advantages of cloud storage? </h1>
                    <p>
                      Security and Backup Storing your files in the cloud completely eliminates the loss of important documentation, 
                      since you will always have a way to recover your information in the event of theft or loss of your devices. 
                      Access to information is something that can be easily regulated,
                       since these means allow you to create permissions and request passwords to access them 
                      for which data theft is almost impossible 
                    </p>
